# Player Statistics List
A Minecraft Forge mod showing relevant statistics about the player and the world around them.

This mod is client-side only, meaning the server(s) you are joining don't need to be modded in order for this mod to work for you.

The code in this project is several years old and in need of a huge refactor. Read it at your own risk. :)

## Requirements
For running:
- Minecraft Forge Client 41.0.98 or higher (MC version 1.19)

For building:
- Java SE Development Kit 17 / OpenJDK 17 or higher
